### FORCE v.3.0
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
+++ General changes and announcements
--- FORCE v. 3.0 is a major update. A lot of modules have received a major
    code overhaul. Much of this is not visible, but internally, code was 
    extensively restructured, simplified, modularized, and optimized.
--- FORCE has a new project landing page:
    https://davidfrantz.github.io/code/force/
--- The code has been moved to GitHub. A self-registration is no longer 
    necessary. 
    https://github.com/davidfrantz
--- The official FORCE paper was published in Remote Sensing. The paper 
    describes FORCE and its underlying principles.
    Frantz 2019: https://doi.org/10.3390/rs11091124
--- FORCE Tutorials are now available! Make sure to regularly check for
    new content:
    https://davidfrantz.github.io/#tutorials
--- An open Google self-help group was set up. FORCE users, please 
    participate, and help others. Together, we can move EO research
    forward. 
    https://groups.google.com/d/forum/force_eo
+++ FORCE has continued to participate in the ACIX II and CMIX inter-
    comparisons (Atmosperic Correction / Cloud Masking Intercomparison
    eXercises). The preliminary results look very good, FORCE is a 
    reliable software framework. 
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
+++ Deprecated programs
--- Due to restructuring, many FORCE programs were removed, but their 
    functionality was integrated and synergised in fewer programs to uni-
    fy usage and simplify code maintenance and reduce redundancy.
--- force-level3, force-tsa, force-cso, force-improphe, force-l2imp are
    now available as submodules in force-higher-level
--- force-parameter-level2, force-parameter-level3, force-parameter-tsa,
    force-parameter-cso, force-parameter-improphe, force-parameter-l2imp
    are now available as submodules in force-parameter
--- force-quicklook-level2, force-quicklook-level3 were removed as support
    for building quicklooks was directly integrated into the respective 
    processing systems.
--- force-level1-sentinel2-long was deprecated for good. Sentinel-2 images
    with the outdated, long naming convention are no longer available. As
    such, this variant of force-level1-sentinel2 is no longer needed.
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
+++ New programs
--- Some new programs are introduced with v. 3.0, which either complement
    new functionality - or integrate several deprecated solo programs.
--- force-cube is a tool to convert any image into datacube format.
    force-cube warps the image to the target projection, and tiles the
    data according to the grid system in use. Various resampling options
    can be used. It is key that a nodata value is given for the input 
    images.
    force-cube can also warp, rasterize, and tile shapefiles. If used with
    shapefiles, masks (1 = occurence of geometry, 0 = no geometry) are 
    generated, which can be used in force-higher-level to speed up 
    analyses. 
--- force-pyramid generates DEFLATE compressed overview images for speedy
    visualization (levels 2 4 8 16). It works well in combination with 
    force-mosaic to generate pyramids for VRT mosaics.
--- force-parameter generates parameter file skeletons for each FORCE 
    module. The skeletons also contain more in depth descriptions for each
    parameter, and supported parameter values/ranges. The descriptions can
    be turned off to generate more compact parameter files. This program
    fully substitutes the various force-parameter-* programs.
--- force-higher-level fully substitutes the deprecated higher level tools
    force-level3, force-tsa, force-cso, force-improphe, and force-l2imp.
    It provides a unified user interface for all higher level functiona-
    lity, and provides a general framework for processing the Level 2 ARD
    products, e.g. the looping over the tiles is handled herein. Several
    new submodules (machine learning, texture, landscape metrics, and 
    sampling) were implemented.
--- force-train allows to train (and validate) machine learning models
    using tables with features, and response variable, respectively. 
    Features may be extracted from any FORCE-derived or compatible data 
    source using the new sampling module in the new force-higher-level 
    program (or any other program). Support Vector Machine and Random 
    Forest models can be used, both as classification or regression. The
    samples can be split into training and validation sets. The trained
    models can be used in force-higher-level to apply the prediction to 
    large datasets.
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
+++ New dependencies
--- The OpenCV library is now a mandatory dependency for the higher-level
    FORCE functionality. OpenCV is used for the newly introduced machine
    learning and texture functionality.
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
+++ CITEME
--- In order to increase fair usage, increase acceptance from external
    developers to integrate their code in FORCE, and to guide users on 
    what references to cite, each FORCE module now generates a "CITEME" 
    file with suggestions for references to be cited. This list is based 
    on the specific parameterization you are using.
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
+++ FORCE L1AS
--- A 'dry-run' option was added to force-level1-sentinel2, which only 
    checks how much data (number and volume) would be downloaded with the 
    parameters you provided. No image will be downloaded.
--- In September 2018, ESA has activated the Long Term Archive (LTA) to 
    roll out old (and potentially infrequently used) data products from 
    the online storage system to offline storage. LTA-support was added to
    force-level1-sentinel2; note that previous versions will crash when 
    encountering LTA images. force-level1-sentinel2 is able to pull data
    from the LTA. However, please note that the data retrieval happens
    at any time  within 24h, and the products stay online for 3 days. If a
    pull request was issued by force-level1-sentinel2, the program will go
    on to the next image. The program needs to be started again after a 
    while to retrieve the potentially restored image. Also note, a user 
    quota is implemented to prevent users from pulling the entire archive 
    - unfortunately this quota is ridicously low, 1 request per hour and 
    user... Hopefully, this will change in the future.
--- force-level1-sentinel2-long was deprecated; see section 'deprecated 
    programs'
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
+++ FORCE AUX
--- force-tabulate-grid can now generate the grid as ESRI shapefile or in
    KML format. This is controlled by an additional parameter, which is
    either set to shp or kml.
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
+++ FORCE L2PS
--- force-parameter-level2 was deprecated, and substituted with the new 
    force-parameter (see new programs section).
--- Performance and portability to different infrastructures was impoved. 
    The RAM requirements were lowered substantially from about 13GB for a
    full Sentinel-2 image to about 8GB while approximately staying at the
    same runtime. Partial images now only use partial RAM, e.g. a Sentinel
    image with half nodata, will only use half the RAM of a full image.
    It is now possible to use hybrid parallelization. The main paralleli-
    zation strategie is still multiprocessing, i.e. single images are pre-
    processed simultaneously. New: each process can use multithreading.
    As multiprocessing is more efficient than multithreading (due to the
    sequential nature of the Level 2 workflow with different parts being
    more suitable for multithreading), we recommend to use as many pro-
    cesses, and as few threads as possible. However, a mild mix may be
    beneficial, e.g. 2 threads / process.  If processing only a few (or 
    one) image, or if RAM is too small, increase the multithreading ratio
    accordingly, this can speed up the work significantly-
--- Parallelization parameters are now specified in the parameter file, 
    even those only used by the batch processor force-level2. NPROC for 
    the number of parallel processes, i.e.  As before, NPROC can be ad-
    justed during runtime. NTHREAD for the number of threads each process 
    may use. Overall, you are using NPROC*NTHREAD cores. 
    Before starting a new process, DELAY seconds are waited (use this if 
    I/O jams occur). 
    PARALLEL_READS controls whether the individual bands of the Level 1 
    input images are read sequentially or in parallel. Note that we obser-
    ved two kinds of GDAL installation: (1) the JPEG driver reads each 
    band parallely, but seprated images in sequence - we recommend to 
    disable PARALLEL_READS in this case (for Sentinel-2). (2) The GDAL
    JPEG drived does not do anything in parallel - use PARALLEL_READ to 
    speed up the work (also use it for Landsat).
    Following table indicates whether this option is used:
                   force-level2    force-l2ps
    NPROC                     X             -
    NTHREAD                   X             X
    DELAY                     X             -
    PARALLEL_READS            X             X
--- Sentinel-2 data with the old, long naming convention are completely 
    gone from ESA archives. For the file queue, and for force-l2ps, it was
    necessary to give the file path to the granule within the Sentinel-2 
    product (because there were several granules). For the sake of usa-
    bility, it is now possible to give the filepath of the top directory, 
    i.e. the *.SAFE directory. For force-level2, it is also possible to
    give the zipfile; force-l2ps needs the extracted file however. Note:
    if you give the top directory, but the image follows the outdated file
    structure, only the first granule will be processed. For the sake of
    backward compatibility, it is still possible to give the filepath of 
    the granule.
--- We encountered an issue with the JP2ECW driver when reading Sentinel-2
    images. The driver performed some kind of high-pass filtering and thus
    sharpened the image (while reading). However, this destroyed radio-
    metry to a degree that the resulting surface reflectance was very un-
    reliable (often negative reflectance). FORCE v. 3.0 removes JP2ECW 
    from the list of potential drivers to open Sentinel-2 images.
--- To clarify that the coud masks are included in the QAI quality bit
    product, the cloud distance product CLD was renamed to DST. The cloud
    distance is not the cloud mask.
--- Cloud masking was improved. For cirrus masking, the elevation-depen-
    dent equation from Baetens et al.: https://doi.org/10.3390/rs11040433
    was implemented. 
--- Cloud shadow matching was accelerated by improving on the FIFO queue 
    for the flood-fill algorithm (circular buffer instead of step-wise 
    allocations). Cloud shadow matching was accelerated by 1) only using 
    pixels in 30m steps (was 2 pixels for Sentinel-2), and 2) by increa-
    sing the step size for the base height iteration to a height that co-
    incides with a horizontal shift of 50m (was 2 pixels).
--- Cloud masking-related QAI flags are not mutually exclusive anymore. 
    E.g. it is now possible to have both the cloud and snow flags on.
--- The SUN_VIEW_GRID parameter that specifies how large the coarse reso-
    lution grid cells for atmospheric modeling are, was removed from the
    parameter file. It was fixed to 5km, which already was the default
    value, and which already was the constant used for Sentinel-2.
--- The AOD estimation in mountains was improved. Before, AOD was often 
    too high, and thus negative reflectance was pretty common. This was
    due to a fixed parameter in equations that scale the AOD with alti-
    tude. Now, the scaling parameter is estimated from the image, and AOD
    overestimations are reduced.
--- The AOD averaging for the 5km coarse grid cells was changed. Before,
    the AOD-from-vegetation map, and the AOD-from-water map were averaged.
    Now, the map is generated by averaging each AOD estimate from each
    target.
--- The logfile logs cloud cover, snow cover, data cover (new), and water 
    cover (new) for each image.
--- A coregistration module was implemented in FORCE L2PS. It was imple-
    mented to improve the georegistration of Sentinel-2 images, see Rufin
    et al.: DOI-TO-COME. For this purpose, the LSReg algorithm developed
    by Yan et al.: https://doi.org/10.3390/rs8060520 was integrated into
    FORCE (thanks Lin for the support). When using this option, FORCE 
    expects a NIR master image that covers the complete image(s) to be
    processed. The image can be a mosaic in vrt format - or any other for-
    mat that is readable by GDAL. The projection of the master mosaic can
    be freely chosen, it does not need to be in the same projection as the
    processed images. FORCE expects that the master image has 12 bands,
    one for each month of the year. We have found, that using multi-annual
    monthly average amages are suitable images for a succesful coregistra-
    tion. FORCE expects that the first five digits of the master image are
    'YYYY-'. Multiple master images can be generated for different years.
    If there are master images '2015-*' and '2020-*', the first image is 
    chosen when processing a 2017 image; the 2nd one is chosen when pro-
    cessing a 2020 image. For details about this strategy, see Rufin et 
    al.: DOI-TO-COME. If the coregistration was unsuccesful, processing of
    the image is aborted. Information about the coregistration (# of tie 
    points, corrected shift etc.) and its success are written to the log-
    file. 
    DIR_MASTER specifies the directory that contain the master mosaics. If 
    DIR_MASTER = NULL, no coregistration is performed. MASTER_NODATA gives
    the nodata value of the master image.
--- The primary processing unit of the higher level processing system has
    changed from tiles to blocks. Accordingly, ARD output is structured in
    blocks. The blocks are horizontal strips, i.e. they are tile-wide, and
    as high as specified with BLOCK_SIZE. The data cube definition file 
    (output of L2PS) has a new line, which holds the BLOCK_SIZE.
--- RGB quicklooks can be generated as regular output. The quicklook is a
    jpeg overview with RGB image, and highlighted quality information.
    cirrus: red, opaque cloud: pink, cloud shadow: cyan, snow: yellow, 
    saturated pixels: orange, subzero reflectance: greenish. Quicklooks
    can be generated using the new OUTPUT_OVV parameter.
--- The PROJECTION tag and the WKT string should be given in one line now.
    In previous version, they needed to be given in two lines due to the
    parsing code employed.
--- There are two pre-defined projection/grid systems available. The EQUI7
    grid is a set of 7 continental equi-distant projections and 100km 
    tiles. The GLANCE7 grid is a set of 7 continental equal-area projec-
    tions and 150km tiles. If one of these options is used in PROJECTION, 
    the values given in ORIGIN_LAT/ORIGIN_LON/TILE_SIZE/BLOCK_SIZE are 
    ignored and internally overwritten with the respective definition.
--- EQUI7 or GLANCE7 may also be used for a single continent. The default
    behaviour is: if the image intersects with one of the continental
    grids, it is processed and output into the continental datacube; this
    is repeated for each of the 7 continents. If you only want to have 
    data for one continent, you can use one of the following subprojec-
    tions: EQUI7-AF, EQUI7-AN, EQUI7-AS, EQUI7-EU, EQUI7-NA, EQUI7-OC, 
    EQUI7-SA. For GLANCE7, it works analogously.
--- Instead of RESOLUTION, the parameters RESOLUTION_LANDSAT and 
    RESOLUTION_SENTINEL2 are now available. With this change, it is now
    possible to use one and the same parameter file for both sensors.
--- In Sentinel-2 images, the metadata with the solar and viewing angle do
    not exactly align with the image data at the Eastern edge of the swath.
    In former FORCE versions, this resulted in a coarse stair-effect (5km)
    at the left side of the image, i.e. a few pixels at the edge of the 
    swath were missing. With the help of some extrapolation, this issue
    is resolved with FORCE v. 3.0
--- The nodata value for the DEM can now be specified (DEM_NODATA). If you
    are using 0, a warning will be displayed as this is a bad choice for
    DEM nodata.
--- The new parameter DIR_LOG defines where to store the logfiles; before
    it was in DIR_LEVEL2 next to the image output.
--- IMPULSE_NOISE detection for the older 8-bit input data (L5/L7) can be
    switched off. 
--- In previous Landsat products, the pixels next to nodata pixels were
    somehow contaminated, probably due to not considering nodata values
    during resampling. BUFFER_NODATA controls whether nodata pixels should
    be buffered by 1 pixel - or not.
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
+++ FORCE WVDB
--- The LAADS HTTP has introduced to request an authentification. Thus, 
    you need to obtain an App Key, see here: 
    https://ladsweb.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/tools-and-services/data-download-scripts/#requesting
    This key needs to be stored in a file .laads in your home directoy.
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
+++ FORCE HIGHER LEVEL
--- force-parameter-level3, force-parameter-tsa, force-parameter-cso, 
    force-parameter-improphe, force-parameter-l2imp were deprecated, and 
    substituted with the new force-parameter (see new programs section).
--- force-level3, force-tsa, force-cso, force-improphe, force-l2imp are
    now available as submodules in force-higher-level. force-higher-level
    integrates all the higher level functionality in one program, and pro-
    vides a general framework for processing the Level 2 ARD products, e.g.
    the looping over the tiles is handled herein. The different submodules
    do still exist, and the parameter files specify which submodule will 
    be executed by force-higher-level.
--- There is now more flexibility with different hardware, especially the
    amount of RAM necessary. Before, the processing was tile-based, which
    means that the tiles were processed sequentially. The primary proces-
    sing unit has changed from tiles to blocks. Accordingly, ARD output is
    structured in blocks. The blocks are horizontal strips, i.e. they are 
    tile-wide, and as high as specified with BLOCK_SIZE. The data cube de-
    finition files have a new line, which holds the BLOCK_SIZE. Tiles are 
    still processed sequentially, but within each tile, the blocks are now
    processed sequentially. A block needs far less RAM than a complete
    tile, especially with long time series and/or high spatial resolution.
    If the default block size is still too large for your system, you can
    override BLOCK_SIZE with a smaller value.
--- A considerable performance boost has been gained by preloading data
    (as e.g. Youtube does). Due to the sequential processing of tiles or
    blocks - and the parallelization on the pixel level, the general data
    access pattern was 
      1) read all necessary data for the tile/block, 
      2) process the data, 
      3) output the results. 
      .. repeat 1)-3) for each processing unit (tile/block)
    This resulted in ressource underutilisation as especially 1) and 3) 
    are I/O bound with very little CPU usage, whereas 2) is CPU-heavy with
    no I/O load. Since v. 3.0, three teams of threads are used to break 
    these read/process/write cycles, i.e.
      Team 1) reads data for the next processing unit (PU+1)
      Team 2) processes the data from the current processing unit (PU)
      Team 3) output the results from the last processing unit (PU-1)
      .. Teams 1)-3) do this simultaneously. Thus, if processing time is
    larger than reading and writing time, there is no CPU underutilisat-
    ion. Each team can have multiple subthreads. NTHREAD_READ controls
    how many images are read parallely, NTHREAD_COMPUTE controls how many
    threads are used to do the per-pixel parallelisation of processing, 
    NTHREAD_WRITE controls how many products are written parallely. 
    force-higher-level tracks how much time is spent for reading, compu-
    ting and writing (I/C/O). During runtime, this indicates whether your
    task is Read-, CPU-, or Write-bound. A summary of the time saved by 
    streaming is displayed upon completion of the task.
--- There are two kinds of higher level submodules, which mainly differ in
    the type of data that is used
      1) Level 2 ARD products, i.e. time- and sensor-stamped inputs
      2) features, i.e. virtually any image data without time- or sensor
         context (e.g. data used for machine learning predictions; often
         output from other higher-level modules, or external data like 
         climate variables - see also force-cube)
--- The filenames of the output products are inferred from the parameter-
    ization for the ARD input. For feature input, a basename needs to be
    defined in the parameterfile.
--- Input data must have one of these file extensions:
      dat: uncompressed binary (ENVI)
      bsq: uncompressed binary (ENVI)
      bil: uncompressed binary (ENVI)
      tif: GeoTiff
      vrt: GDAL Virtual Format
    Unexpected files, e.g. *.ovr etc do not cause errors anymore.
--- Analysis masks are now specified using their directory (DIR_MASK, 
    should contain masks, and their basename (BASE_MASK).
--- The Higher Level Processing System is able to process Best Available
    Pixel composites as input images (instead or in addition to Level 2).
    To make this work, both the BAP and INF products need to be present 
    (both are output products of the Level 3 submodule), and you need to 
    use the SENSOR as it appears in the filename of these products.
--- The Higher Level Processing System is able to process Sentinel-1 SAR
    data! You can perform all available time series analyses, Spectral 
    Temporal Metrics, compositing etc. as if it would be a spectral index
    from optical data. Please note however that there is no FORCE module 
    implemented to preprocess the SAR data (any volunteers to integrate 
    this?). The S1 data need to be prepared in a FORCE-compatible format: 
    they need to be in the correct tiling scheme (see e.g. force-cube), 
    have two bands (1: VV polarization, 2: VH polarization), signed 16bit 
    integers with scaled backscatter in the order of -1000s, nodata value 
    needs to be -9999. Four new "sensors" (like LND08 or SEN2A) have been 
    introduced, i.e.
      S1AIA: Sentinel-1A IW Ascending
      S1AID: Sentinel-1A IW Descending
      S1BIA: Sentinel-1B IW Ascending
      S1BID: Sentinel-1B IW Descending
    This allows to merge (or keep them separated) data from ascending and
    descending orbits, and from S1A and S1B.
    Data needs to be named like this: 20180108_LEVEL2_S1AIA_SIG.tif
    The file extension must be dat, bsq, bil, tif, or vrt.
--- Parameters that indicate ranges were changed. E.g. X_TILE_MIN, and 
    X_TILE_MAX were consolidated in X_TILE_RANGE.
--- For the ARD input type, the time range is now specified in a conso-
    lidated way across submodules. The DATE_RANGE parameter (YYYY-MM-DD)
    specifies the general slice of the time series used for the analysis.
    The DOY_RANGE parameter acts as filter on DATE_RANGE to limit pro-
    cessing to a seasonal rangem e.g. to only use summer images. DOY_RANGE
    can extend over the years for winter seasons/Southern hemisphere.
--- For the Time Series Analysis module, multiple indices can be selected 
    at once, and the processing will generate all available output data 
    for each index. While this is very handy, please keep in mind that -
    depending on parameterization - you can potentially generate an 
    absurd amount of results and quickly fill up disc space. Fully para-
    meterized, FORCE TSA can output 5100 products! Each of these products
    are multi-band images. Some of these products, e.g. interpolated time 
    series, can have 1000s of bands. Use with care.
--- Additional indices were implemented: 
       NDBI (normalized difference building index), 
       NDWI (normalized difference water index),
      mNDWI (modified normalized difference water index),
       NDSI (normalized difference snow index).
--- A time series noise filtering was implemted, which can remove outliers
    on a per-pixel basis. Noise is estimated using the method described in
    Vermote et al.: https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2008.2005977. Outliers 
    are iteratively eliminated until the largest residual is smaller than
    ABOVE_NOISE. To further reduce commission errors of the cloud/cloud
    shadow masks, masked pixels that have a residual smaller than 
    BELOW_NOISE are restored.
--- The DOYs and corresponding scoring function values in the Level 3 
    module are now given wih two parameters only, i.e.
      DOY_SCORE_0 = 120     -->
      DOY_SCORE_1 = 180     --> DOY_SCORE = 120 180 240
      DOY_SCORE_2 = 240     -->
      DOY_STATIC_0 = 0.01   -->
      DOY_STATIC_1 = 0.99   --> DOY_STATIC = 0.01 0.99 0.01
      DOY_STATIC_2 = 0.01   -->
--- The LSP files for the phenology-adaptive compositing (PAC) in the 
    Level 3 module are now given as basenames (instead of patterns), and
    are given with one parameter only, i.e.
      LSP_PATTERN_PAR_0 = POS
      LSP_PATTERN_PAR_1 = EOS --> LSP_FILE = LSP-POS.tif LSP-EOS.tif LSP-MOS.tif
      LSP_PATTERN_PAR_2 = MOS
--- In version 2, there was an overlap between Spectral Temporal Metrics,
    which were formerly a by-product of the compositing process in the 
    Level 3 module - and basic statistics in the Time Series Analysis 
    module. Those two concepts were merged, and are now available in the
    Time Series Analysis module as "Spectral Temporal Metrics" (STMs). 
    Thus, the STMs are no longer sitting behind the compositing-specific
    quality filtering (which had both pros and cons). STMs can now be com-
    puted for any index requested, i.e. for any spectral band, and for 
    each available index. STMs can be computed based on the regular time
    series, or based on the interpolated time series. The user can request
    a custom set of STMs, e.g. only average and standard deviation. Quan-
    tiles can be freely requested, e.g. the 37% quantile. In total, 107
    STMs can be generated.
--- Several time series folds can now be computed within the same run.
    For each fold, trends or change+trends can be computed. A quarterly
    folding option was introduced. The available statistics to perform
    the folding have substantially increased: 107 statistics can now
    be used (101 quantiles, range, IQR, mean, std, skewness, kurtosis).
--- Land Surface Phenology metrics can now be freely selected. Before, 
    all 26 available metrics were output. The user can define an amplitude
    threshold (LSP_MIN_AMPLITUDE), which suppresses the computation of
    phenometrics for non-seasonal land covers. An index value threshold 
    (LSP_MIN_VALUE) can be defined to suppresses the computation of pheno-
    metrics for unvegetated pixels. The user can set the amplitude thre-
    shold (LSP_AMP_THRESHOLD), which is used to determine Start and End of
    Season, defaults to 0.2. The spline fit can be output, too. For each 
    requested metric, trends or change+trends can be computed. 
--- In the Clear-Sky Observations (CSO) module, the statistics can now be
    freely chosen. Besides the number of observations, 107 statistics on
    the temporal distance between obaservations can be computed (101 quan-
    tiles, range, IQR, mean, std, skewness, kurtosis).
--- To reduce confusion, the ImproPhe module was renamed to "Continuous 
    Field ImproPhe". The parameter file should now be enclosed by the 
    tags "++PARAM_CFIMP_START++" and "++PARAM_CFIMP_END++" (instead of 
    "++PARAM_IMP_START++" and "++PARAM_IMP_END++"). 
    The coarse resolution continuous fields (input), are now expected to
    be in datacube format. Before, the images were warped to the extent
    of the tiles. This was done to increase consistency within the higher
    level program, and to only need to rely on a single data input mecha-
    nism. For cubing the continuous fields, see the new program force-cube
--- In the Level 2 ImproPhe and Continuous Field ImproPhe modules, the 
    prediction and texture kernel are now given as radius, before it was 
    in diameter.
--- To reduce confusion, the parameter USE_IMPROPHE in the ARD-specific 
    higher level modules was renamed to USE_L2_IMPROPHE to clarify that 
    this relates to the output of the Level 2 ImproPhe module, i.e. spa-
    tially improved ARD datasets - and not to the spatially improved con-
    tinous field outputs as generated with the Continuous Field ImproPhe
    module.
--- A new module was added: the Machine Learning module. 
    This module allows the application of machine learning models (e.g. 
    trained with force-train, see new programs above) to predict a vari-
    able, e.g. classification or quantitative variable (fraction, biomass 
    etc). Implemented are regression and classification flavors of Random 
    Forest and Support Vector Machines (ML_METHOD). The features need to 
    be given with the INPUT_FEATURE parameters, which can be given multi-
    ple times. The given features must correspond to the features that 
    were used to train the model (e.g. force-train). The model(s) must be 
    in OpenCV xml format, and must be stored in DIR_MODEL. Multiple models
    can be given, in which case the average (mode) of the predictions will
    be used for regression (classification). A convergence factor 
    (ML_CONVERGENCE) can be specified for the regression. If the models 
    converge, i.e. the average of the ensemble does not change when adding
    predictions from more models, no more predictions are added (saves 
    time). This is done on the pixel-level, i.e. different pixels may be 
    averaged using a  different amount of predictions. The OUTPUT_MLI 
    product provides the number of models used for each pixel. The 
    OUTPUT_MLU model provides the standard deviation of the predictions 
    used for each pixel.
    Multiple modelsets can be given, in which case multiple predictions 
    are performed, e.g. a crop classification, land cover classification
    and tree species classififcation can be computed in the same run. The
    different predictions are stored as separate bands in the output file. 
    A scaling factor (ML_SCALE) can be specified to scale to prediction 
    to 16bit integers.
--- A new module was added: the Texture module. 
    This module allows the computation of texture metrics. Currently im-
    plemented are morphological operators, i.e. open, close, erode, dilate,
    gradient, tophat and blackhat. The metrics can be computed on any 
    feature provided with the INPUT_FEATURE parameters, which can be given 
    multiple times. TXT_RADIUS defines the radius in projection units, and
    TXT_ITERATION defines the number of iterations the morphological op-
    earionts are performed.
--- A new module was added: the Sampling module. 
    This module takes a table with geographic coordinates and a response
    variable. Each feature provided with the INPUT_FEATURE parameters will 
    be sampled, which can be given multiple times. The module outputs a 
    file with the sampled features (FILE_SAMPLE), the corresponding res-
    ponse variable (FILE_RESPONSE), and the corresponding coordinates 
    (FILE_COORDINATES). Note that the derived samples are not in the same
    order as the input table, as force-higher-level follows a tile/block-
    based processing order. Points that are outside of the provided spa-
    tial extent are not sampled, too. The parameter FEATURE_EXCLUDE con-
    trols wheter a sample is taken if one of the features has a nodata 
    value. The output of this file can serve as input for force-train to
    train machine learning modules.

### FORCE v.2.1
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
+++ FORCE L2PS
--- Bugfix: One line was missing in the parameter file generated by force-
    parameter-level2. You can now ignore the red comment in the 2.0 User
    Guide on p. 21.
--- Bugfix: There was a bug in a bugfix introduced in v. 2.0.. When creat-
    ing datacubes (DO_REPROJ = TRUE and DO_TILE = TRUE), data were consis-
    tently missing in some areas at the South-East border of Sentinel-2 
    MGRS tiles. The occurence of this effect was dependent on the relative
    location of the MGRS tiles to the upper-left tile in the custom grid 
    system. Should be all OK now.
--- Bugfix: The cloud cover percentage (and similar) in the metadata was
    not correct for tiles that are located at the intersection of differ-
    ent MGRS/WRS-2 frames. Only the numbers provided in the QAI product 
    were correct. Is now correct for all products.

### FORCE v.2.0
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
+++ General changes
--- Follow FORCE on social media. ResearchGate: https://www.researchgate.n
    et/project/FORCE-Framework-for-Operational-Radiometric-Correction-for-
    Environmental-monitoring. Twitter: #FORCE_EO
--- There are many new features throughout all FORCE modules, and there 
    are entirely new modules. The new features generally come with new
    parameters in the parameter files, which you need to add to your exis-
    ting parameter files (from old FORCE versions). If you are seeing an  
    error like this, simply add the new parameters (have a look at the 
    user guide for details and possible values): 
    'OUTPUT_FORMAT is not specified. Unable to read parameter file!'
--- All products can now be output as ENVI Standard or GeoTiff. An ENVI 
    header is written for both options. The first option produces uncom-
    pressed flat binary files. The GeoTiff come with LZW-compression using
    horizontal differencing. A new parameter OUTPUT_FORMAT was added to 
    all parameter files. All FORCE modules can digest both formats.
--- All FORCE modules are more verbose and will show some progress bar.
--- The writing of all output is now accompanied by locking the file (even
    if it does not exist yet). This prevents possible data races when wri-
    ting one and the same output file from two threads. Note that there is
    the possibility that the lockfile cannot be generated, in which case
    no output can be written. If this happens, please refer to the FAQ 
    section in the user guide to resolve this issue. This generally occurs
    if you have aborted FORCE before (lockfile was not deleted correctly)
    or if too much I/O is causing a timeout of the lock attempt.
--- Directories are now created with 775 permissions instead of 700. Note
    that your umask settings might reduce these permissions.
--- If there is a reading error for any file, the error message includes
    the filename.
--- There are more metadata written to all outputs, e.g. the parameteriza-
    tion, information about your system, processing time, FORCE version,
    band names etc.
--- A bibtex file including FORCE citations is now included in the sofware
    package.
--- A bibtex file including studies that used FORCE, is now included in 
    the sofware package. If you publish anything enabled or related to 
    FORCE, please send me your published papers (pdf+DOI). They will be 
    included in the bibtext file of the next version: 
    david.frantz@geo.hu-berlin.de #FORCE_EO
--- Recognizing the different user needs, quality screening for all higher
    level FORCE modules (above Level 2) is now in full user control. The 
    parameter SCREEN_QAI was added to all parameter files. Have a look at 
    the user guide for all possible keywords and quality filters. Please
    make proper use of the quality information and never analyze any data
    without.
--- The sensor list (SENSORS = ...) in the parameter file of all higher-
    level FORCE modules (above Level 2) has two additional key words: 
    sen2a and sen2b (all lowercase) refer to the original Sentinel-2A/B 
    10m bands only. Note that FORCE matches the Landsat NIR band with the
    original Sentinel-2A/B 20m NIR band; therefore, using 
    "SENSORS = LND08 sen2a" will only return the VIS bands. Have a look at
    the matching table FORCE uses for combining several sensors, and read
    the next change entry.
    SENSOR B G R RE1 RE2 RE3 PNIR NIR SW1 SW2 
    LND04  1 2 3   -   -   -    -   4   5   6
    LND05  1 2 3   -   -   -    -   4   5   6
    LND07  1 2 3   -   -   -    -   4   5   6
    LND08  1 2 3   -   -   -    -   4   5   6
    SEN2A  1 2 3   4   5   6    7   8   9  10
    SEN2B  1 2 3   4   5   6    7   8   9  10
    sen2a  1 2 3   -   -   -    7   -   -   -
    sen2b  1 2 3   -   -   -    7   -   -   -
--- The filenames of the higher-level FORCE outputs (above Level 2) have 
    changed slightly. Before, the tag "MULTI" was a placeholder for the
    sensor. Now, it is one of the following and merely refers to a named
    set of spectral bands instead of individual sensors: 1) "LNDLG" refers
    to the 6 Landsat legacy bands (B/G/R/NIR/SW1/SW2). It occurs if you 
    select one or several Landsat sensors (even if you additionally use 
    SEN2A and/or SEN2B). "SEN2L" refers to the 10 Sentinel-2 land surface 
    bands (B/G/R/RE1/RE2/RE3/PNIR/NIR/SW1/SW2). It occurs if you only se-
    lect SEN2A and/or SEN2B. "SEN2H" refers to the 4 high-resolution Sen-
    tinel-2 bands (B/G/R/PNIR). It occurs if you only select sen2a and/or
    sen2b. "R-G-B" refers to visual bands only. It occurs if you select 
    one or several Landsat sensors plus sen2a and/or sen2b. See the match-
    ing table above for details.
--- The spatial data cube definition is appended to each gridded data 
    cube. The file contains (1) projection as WKT string, (2) origin of 
    the tile system as geographic Longitude, (3) origin of the tile system
    as geographic Latitude, (4) origin of the tile system as projected X-
    coordinate, (5) origin of the tile system as projected Y-coordinate, 
    and (6) width of the tiles in projection units.
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
+++ FORCE L1AS
--- force-level1-sentinel2 shows the filename of the current download, 
    progress bar, downloaded size, download speed and eta per download.
    Note that the progress bar and eta are produced by wget.  Afaik, there
    is no way to change the format.
--- The L1AS programs have a new mandatory argument. The file name of the
    file queue needs to be given. This enables you to manage several pro-
    ject in one data pool. If the file queue exists, new files will be 
    appended at the end. If not, the file will be created.
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
+++ FORCE L2PS
--- The GeoTiff driver is more picky with the output projection. Make sure 
    to validate your WKT string using "gdalsrsinfo -v 'YOUR_WKT_STRING'".
    I have improved the definition of the default projection in force-para
    meter-level2 to work with GeoTiff.
--- The number of CPUs can be re-adjusted while(!) force-level2 is run-
    ning. A file 'cpu-$TIME' is temporarily created in DIR_TEMP. This file
    can be modified. Note that the effect is not immediate, as the load is
    only adjusted after one of the running jobs (images) is finished.
--- Added a custom delay for starting new jobs in force-level2. This pre-
    vents a huge I/O-related bottleneck at the beginning of processing. As
    a result, it may take a while (depending on how many cores you are us-
    ing) until force-level2 runs at full efficiency. An additional parame-
    ter needs to be given for force-level2 (delay in seconds).
--- force-level2 shows eta (this will only show reasonable numbers after a
    couple of jobs are finsihed). The estimate is based on the runtime of 
    finished jobs, so the first estimate will only be shown when the first
    job has finished. Note that the progress bar and eta are produced by
    GNU parallel. Afaik, there is no way to change the format; sorry for 
    the eta in seconds...
--- The processing time is written to the logfile.
--- There is a slight problem, which seemingly occurs on CIFS-mounted win-
    dows shares. Attempting to lock the file queues will fail and will 
    throw a warning. This is not a fatal error. Please see the FAQ in the
    user guide if this happens on your system. I didn't find a solution 
    yet.
--- Hopefully fixed a bug that changed file permissions of the file queue
    to read-only (this is related to "sed -i" and seems to occur on some 
    Linux systems only). 
--- Changed behaviour of the subzero QAI flag: Subzero = any band < 0.0.
    If reflectance < -1.0, the pixel is set to nodata.
--- Changed behaviour of the surface reflectance output when saturation is
    detected. Previously, reflectance was capped at 1.0. Now, values > 1.0
    and < 2.0 are allowed, but still flagged as saturated. Pixels with any 
    reflectance > 2.0 are set to nodata.
--- Improved the performance of the shadow probability computation in the 
    cloud/shadow detection module. The shadow probability is only computed
    for pixels that are close enough to a cloud. A maximum cloud height of
    12000m + max. sun zenith of scene is assumed; sun azimuth is not taken
    into account so far.
--- Snow mask switched on for Sentinel-2. Increased NDSI threshold to re-
    duce comission because of the missing thermal band, included a SWIR2 
    threshold to counterbalance.
--- Reduced cloud/cloud shadow/snow/water ambiguity. Now, a pixel cannot 
    be cloud and snow, or water and snow at the same time. Water takes 
    precedence over snow. Snow takes precedence over cloud. Note that snow
    and cold clouds can be easily confused. No shadow is matched for snow 
    pixels (will increase error of omission to a certain degree). Opaque 
    clouds, and buffered clouds take precedence over cirrus clouds. Clouds
    take precedence over cloud shadows.
--- Decreased the aggresivity of the cirrus mask by incorporating a blue
    test. Cirri are not buffered anymore.
--- Reduced cloud shadow comission errors by incorporating the shadow pro-
    bability in the computation of the shadow match similarity. This will 
    favor stonger shadows and shadows won't simply snap to all dark fea-
    tures (like coniferous forest).
--- Snow coverage in percent is written to the logfile.
--- Implemented more efficient method to interpolate coarse resolution at-
    mospheric parameters, + elevation-dependent parameters are computed 
    for smaller elevation increments -> resulting atmospheric variables 
    like AOD look much smoother
--- Fixed a bug in the geometric module, which appeared when warping and 
    tiling images. The result was a possible subpixel misalignment as the
    images were simply warped into the target coordinate system without 
    aligning the new extent with the tiling grid.
--- The conversion from DN to physical units is now based on the reflec-
    tance calibration factors for Landsat as suggested by Kurt Thome @
    ACIX. As the ESUN spectrum is not used anymore, the remove-then-add
    calibration employed for Sentinel-2 was removed, too.
--- There are three different resolution merge options available to in-
    crease the spatial resolution of the 20m Sentinel-2 bands to 10m. The
    default algorithm has changed from REGRESSION to IMPROPHE. Other op-
    tions are STARFM and NONE. See user guide for more details.
--- The use of the DODB was deprecated. The parameters were removed from
    the parameter files. This feature has never made it into an official
    FORCE release; before the release of FORCE v. 1.0, measures were im-
    plemented to make the AOD estimation more reliable; therefore results 
    were fine without using it. Given the extra processing step (non-line-
    arity in processing) and used disk space, I decided to completely re-
    move this functionality.
--- Fixed a potential data race when writing one and the same output file 
    from two threads. Now, a lockfile is created to prevent this. Parallel
    writes can happen as FORCE implements a Level 2 compositing to reduce
    data redundancy, i.e. if two different Level 1 products cover the same
    Level 2 tile. By doing so, the compositing method was changed too. Be-
    fore, it was simply overwriting with the latest data. Now, the exis-
    ting file is read, then the average between the old and new data is 
    computed, and the file is written completely again. This method pro-
    duces more smooth transitions between Level 1 footprints. Note that 
    the old overwrite with latest data method is still used for the QAI
    layer.
--- It is now possible to process images without a DEM, although this is 
    not recommended. If doing so, the DEM is assumed to be flat @ z=0m. 
    Cloud detection and atmospheric correction both benefit from using a 
    DEM. If topographic correction is to be used, L2PS will exit with an 
    error. To disable, use FILE_DEM = NULL, and DO_TOPO = FALSE.
--- Added wavelength domain tags to bandnames for BOA/TOA products.
--- Data cover, cloud cover (opaque, buffered and cirrus), cloud shadow 
    cover, snow cover and water cover is written to the metadata.
--- force-quicklook-level2 has an additional argument, which defines the
    stretch (max vis value in linear stretch). Before, it was fixed to 
    1000 (10% reflectance), which is inappropriate in bright landscapes.
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
+++ FORCE L3PS
--- If the target resolution is lower than the Level 2 data, the spatial 
    aggregation can be performed using an approximated Point Spread Func-
    tion. Note that this option severely affects input time. A new para-
    meter REDUCE_PSF was added to the parameter file.
--- force-level3 is more verbose, shows progress, eta, relative time spent
    for input/computing/output operations (note: it is not pure I/O time, 
    it is rather a measurement of all input/output related things, e.g. 
    the CPU time spent with REDUCE_PSF would count as input), and composi-
    ting statistics at the end. The eta is based on the runtime of finis-
    hed tiles, so the first estimate will only be shown after the first 
    tile has finished.
--- BAP composites look mostly crappy over water because it is a very va-
    riable surface type. Therefore, the compositing method is switched 
    over permanent water, i.e. if > 90% of obs are water-flagged. Over 
    water, minimum SWIR2 compositing is used, while enforcing that NIR re-
    flectance is greater than SWIR2. Will only be used for sensors with 
    NIR and SWIR2 band.
--- force-level3 can use Level 2 ImproPhe data (will use original data, 
    i.e. BOA/TOA, if there is no IMP product for any specific date), gene-
    rated by the new tool force-level2-improphe (see section FORCE L2IMP 
    below). A new parameter USE_IMPROPHE was added to the parameter file.
--- Added wavelength domain tags to bandnames for reflectance products.
--- force-quicklook-level3 has an additional argument, which defines the
    stretch (max vis value in linear stretch). Before, it was fixed to 
    1000 (10% reflectance), which is inappropriate in bright landscapes.
--- force-level3-mosaic was deprectared, and replaced by the new force-
    mosaic, which can mosaic all FORCE-generated, tiled outputs.
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
+++ FORCE TSA
--- FORCE TSA has received a major update and many new features. There are
    many new parameters that you need to include in your existing parame-
    ter files.
--- If the target resolution is lower than the Level 2 data, the spatial 
    aggregation can be performed using an approximated Point Spread Func-
    tion. Note that this option severely affects input time. A new para-
    meter REDUCE_PSF was added to the parameter file.
--- force-tsa is more verbose, shows progress, eta, relative time spent
    for input/computing/output operations (note: it is not pure I/O time, 
    it is rather a measurement of all input/output related things, e.g. 
    the CPU time spent with REDUCE_PSF would count as input). The eta is 
    based on the runtime of finished tiles, so the first estimate will on-
    ly be shown after the first tile has finished.
--- force-tsa can use Level 2 ImproPhe data (will use original data, i.e. 
    BOA/TOA, if there is no IMP product for any specific date), generated
    by the new tool force-level2-improphe (see section FORCE L2IMP below).
    A new parameter USE_IMPROPHE was added to the parameter file.
--- Only bands that are needed to compute the requested index are read 
    from disc. This decreases time spent for reading data. As an example,
    only red and NIR are read for calculating NDVI time series.
--- Fixed a bug that caused a core dump when outputting the TSS product 
    with more than 1169 images.
--- Instead of a 'simple' spectral index or band, linear spectral unmixing
    can be used. Use INDEX = SMA. Several parameters were added to the pa-
    rameter file. The endmember file is specified with FILE_ENDMEM. Only
    the abundance image related to one endmember is retained (this will 
    likely change in future versions). The SMA can be Sum-to-One constrai-
    ned using the parameter SMA_SUM_TO_ONE. The SMA can be Non-Nega-tivity
    constrained using the parameter SMA_NON_NEG. The fractions can be sha-
    de normalized, using the parameter SMA_SHD_NORM. The shade spectrum 
    (photogrammetric zero or measured shade) need to go into the last
    column of the endmember file. The RMSE time series of the SMA can be 
    output using the parameter OUTPUT_RMS.
--- Red Edge bands (RE1, RE2, RE3) and the broad NIR band (BNIR) of Senti-
    nel-2 can be used as INDEX.
--- Implemented Disturbance Index without rescaling, i.e. no spatially tu-
    ned z-transformation. INDEX = TC-DI0.
--- Time series rescaling can now be requested individually for TSS, TSI,
    FB* and LSP products.
--- Time series can be interpolated. Several parameters were added to the 
    parameter file. The interpolation method is set with INTERPOLATE. Cur-
    rently implemented are NONE (no interpolation), LINEAR (linear inter-
    polation), MOVING (running mean interpolation / smoothing), and RBF 
    (Radial Basis Function interpolation / smoothing). The maximum tempo-
    ral distance (i.e. filter width) for the MOVING filter, is set with 
    MOVING_MAX (in days). Several kernels can be used for the RBF filters
    using RBF_SIGMA, the sigma(s) are given in days. The kernel strengths
    are adapted by weighting with actual data availability within the time
    covered by each kernel. The parameter RBF_CUTOFF specifies a cutoff 
    value for temporally truncating the kernels, such that e.g. 95% of the
    Gaussian bell is retained. The time step for the interpolation is set
    with INT_DAY (in days). The interpolated time series can be output 
    with OUTPUT_TSI.
--- Land Surface Phenology (LSP) can be derived from dense timeseries. The
    Spline Analysis of Time Series (SPLITS) API was incorporated for this 
    purpose. FORCE can be compiled with and without SPLITS, in the latter 
    case, the new functionality won't be available. See the user guide for
    instructions on how to install with SPLITS. A number of new parameters
    were added to the parameter file, and new products can be output. LSP
    extraction is triggered by using LSP as folding option (FOLD = LSP), 
    or when OUTPUT_LSP = TRUE. The number of segments for fitting the 
    splines needs to be specified using the LSP_N_SEGMENT parameter. To 
    derive LSP metrics for a given year, some data from the previous and 
    next year need to be included (LSP_DOY_PREV_YEAR, LSP_DOY_NEXT_YEAR).
    The user can select if a Northern hemisphere, Southern hemisphere or 
    mixed phenology is expected (LSP_HEMISPHERE). In total, 26 LSP metrics
    will be derived for each year.
--- The change and trend (TRD/CAT) products can be computed on the annual
    LSP metrics. This will produce 26 change / trend products.
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
+++ FORCE CSO
--- New module FORCE Clear Sky Observations (FORCE CSO) is intended for 
    data availability mining. For given time steps (e.g. 3 months), per-
    pixel statistics about data availability are calculated, i.e. number 
    of CSOs, and average (standard deviation, min, max, etc.) days between
    consecutive CSOs. FORCE CSO includes the programs force-parameter-cso
    to generate an empty parameter file, and force-cso to do the data mi-
    ning.
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
+++ FORCE ImproPhe
--- New module FORCE Improving the Spatial Resolution of Land Surface Phe-
    nology (FORCE ImproPhe) is intended to to increase the spatial resolu-
    tion of coarse continuous fields. It was originally developed to re-
    fine Land Surface Phenology metrics derived from MODIS, using sparse 
    Landsat data as spectral and multi-temporal targets for data fusion. 
    Regarding phenology, it can be used to obtain a Landsat-like phenology
    even in areas / during times when Landsat data alone is insufficient 
    (in terms of temporal density). FORCE permits the use of Landsat and/
    or Sentinel-2 data as target datasets for the improPhement. ImproPhe 
    can also be applied to other coarse resolution data. FORCE ImproPhe
    includes the programs force-parameter-improphe to generate an empty 
    parameter file, and force-improphe to perform the data fusion.

+++ FORCE L2IMP
--- New module FORCE Level 2 ImproPhe (FORCE L2IMP) is intended to increa-
    se the spatial resolution of lower resolution Level 2 ARD using higher
    resolution Level 2 ARD, e.g. to improve the spatial resolution of 30m
    Landsat imagery to 10m using Sentinel-2 data as targets. This only 
    works for years where both data sources exist. The data fusion is per-
    formed with the ImproPhe algorithm. Note that this module is heavy on
    processing time. FORCE L2IMP includes the programs force-parameter-
    l2imp to generate an empty parameter file, and force-l2imp to perform 
    the data fusion.

+++ FORCE WVDB
--- Collection 6 data were removed from LAADS' servers, leaving force-lut-
    modis nonfunctional. The code was updated to make use of collection 
    6.1.
--- Due to new NASA policies, LAADS' FTP was shut down, leaving force-lut-
    modis nonfunctional. The code was updated to make use of the HTTPS 
    server.
--- The water vapor climatology has a new column: standard deviation of 
    monthly water vapor. This information is just for estimating the va-
    riability for each coordinate/month, and so for the usability of the
    climatology. This information is not used by FORCE L2PS, thus the old
    tables can still be used.
--- We compiled a ready-to-use, global water vapor database. The dataset 
    is comprised of daily global water vapor data for February 2000 to Ju-
    ly 2018 for each land-intersecting Worldwide Reference System 2 (WRS-
    2) scene, as well as a monthly climatology that can be used if no dai-
    ly value is available. The dataset is freely available at 
    https://doi.pangaea.de/10.1594/PANGAEA.893109 under the terms of the 
    CC BY 3.0 license. This dataset may relieve you of the burden to gene-
    rate the water vapor database on your own.
--- Fixed a bug in force-lut-modis in finding intersecting MODIS granules.
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
+++ FORCE AUX
--- Added new program 'force-mosaic', which generates virtual mosaics from
    tiled products in Virtual Dataset format. This tool can be used with 
    any tiled FORCE output, i.e. Level 2 / Level 3 / TSA / CSO / ImproPhe.
    force-mosaic mosaicks everything with the same basename. It Will like-
    ly fail for products that have different number of bands in different 
    tiles; this especially applies to the TSS product of force-tsa. The 
    previous, per-module mosaic tools are deprecated.
--- There is a new mandatory parameter in force-qai-inflate, which speci-
    fies the output format, i.e. ENVI or GTiff.
--- The usage of force-tile-finder has slightly changed. Before, the Level
    2 parameter file needed to be given as input (containing the defini-
    tion of projection and grid). Now, each data cube is accompanied by a 
    spatial data cube definition, Therefore, only the directory of any 
    gridded data cube needs to be given (containing a data cube definition
    file). An additional parameter ‘resolution’ was added to relate geo-
    graphic coordinates to pixel positions, denoting that products with 
    multiple resolutions may be present in a data cube.
--- The usage of force-tabulate-grid has slightly changed. Before, the 
    Level 2 parameter file needed to be given as input (containing the de-
    finition of projection and grid). Now, each data cube is accompanied 
    by a spatial data cube definition, Therefore, only the directory of 
    any gridded data cube needs to be given (containing a data cube defi-
    nition file).

### FORCE v.1.1 beta
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
+++ FORCE L1AS
--- Download and management support for Sentinel-2B, higher level support
    was already implemented.
--- The Sentinel-2 downloader/archiver has 4 new mandatory arguments/fil-
    ters: sensing-start-time sensing-end-time min-cloud-cover max-cloud-
    cover.
--- Fixed a bug when importing Landsat images with white-space characters
    in the directory name; now, this thows an error.
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
+++ FORCE L2PS
--- Reduced memory requirements for holding TOA reflectance internally by
    ~0.72GB (Landsat 4-7)
    ~0.95GB (Landsat 8)
    ~2.92GB (Sentinel-2)
--- Reduced memory requirements when correcting for adjacency effects by
    ~1.20GB (Landsat 4-8)
    ~2.24GB (Sentinel-2)
--- Fixed a bug in the BRDF correction of the Landsat 8 SWIR-2 band.
--- BRDF correction is now available for Sentinel-2.
--- Relative Spectral Response Function for Sentinel-2B is now included. 
--- Relative Spectral Response Function of Landsat 4 TM was updated. 
--- Improved gasweous vapor transmittance calculations. The water vapor 
    absorption spectrum was updated to the HITRAN 2016 database (obtained
    from HITRAN on the Web, http://hitran.iao.ru/) The computation of wa-
    ter vapor absorption and water vapor and ozone transmittance was cor-
    rected: a numerical error in calculating transmittance resulted in in-
    creased SWIR-1 reflectance in Landsat-TM data.
--- The spectral resolution of all tables was reduced from 0.1 nm to 1 nm.
--- Added bandnames to all output products.
--- Cloud shadow matching for Sentinel-2 images is now performed on the 20
    m resolution, which significantly speeds up the work, especially for 
    poorly illuminated winter images where the base height is iterated in 
    small vertical increments
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
+++ FORCE L3PS
--- Added new parameter OFF_SEASON, which allows the compositing algorithm
    to select clear-sky observations that are not within the prime season
    of interest. This may be advantageous if gap-free images are needed.
    This parameter also affects the temporal-spectral metrics. If enabled,
    the statistics will be derived over the complete year, instead of the
    prime season of interest.
--- Added new parameters OUTPUT_Q25, OUTPUT_Q50, OUTPUT_Q75 and OUTPUT_IQR
    that allow the computation of 25%/50%/75% quantiles and interquantile
    range, defined as Q75 - Q25.
--- Added new parameter LSP_START, which allows you to input LSP data with
    a custom starting point. Previously, the LSP data had to be provided 
    as YEAR*365+DOY. The new parameter specifies an offset as Y*365+DOY. 
    Thus, if the LSP are provided as before, LSP_START = 1. If the LSP da-
    ta would be provided relative to January 1 2000, LSP_START = 730001, 
    i.e. 2000*365+1.
--- Fixed a bug, which resulted in no data when using the phenology-adap-
    tive compositing with only one year of LSP data.
--- Removed unused parameter LSP_NUM_YEAR.
--- Added new program 'force-level3-mosaic', which generates virtual mosa-
    ics from tiled Level 3 products in Virtual Dataset format. Due to per-
    formance considerations, it is adviced to enable tiled output in force
    -level3, and if necessary, use this new tool to create mosaics. force-
    -quicklook-level3 was updated to generate quicklooks from the vrt mos-
    aics.
--- Added bandnames to all output products.
--- Negative tile numbers are now allowed.
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
+++ FORCE TSA
--- Added product id as metadata for time series stack output.
--- Parallel processing can be used. New parameter was added to parameter
    file. Computation of TC-DI is currently not parallelized.
--- Added bandnames to all output products.
--- Negative tile numbers are now allowed.
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
+++ FORCE WVDB
--- Collection 5 geometa tables were removed from LAADS' FTP server, lea-
    ving force-lut-modis nonfunctional. The code was updated to make use 
    of collection 6.
--- Discovered a randomly occuring bug, seemingly related to a data race 
    in localtime(): the function timer was set to tomorrow, resulting in
    a never-ending while loop. Measures were implemented to avoid this 
    data race.
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
+++ FORCE AUX
--- Added a new program, 'force', which prints the version number and a
    short disclaimer.
--- Fixed a bug of missing resolution in force-qai-inflate outputs.
--- force-tabulate-grid was completely overworked. Instead of a table with
    coordinates, a shapefile is directly generated, which let's you easily
    relate to the processing grid.
--- Added bandnames to all output products (force-qai-inflate).
