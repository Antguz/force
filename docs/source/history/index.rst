Version History
===============

This section displays the changelogs for each published FORCE version.

FORCE uses a three-level versioning scheme:


v. 3.0.1

* 1st level: major release

  Significant changes will result in a new major release.

* 2nd level: minor release

  Minor changes like new features, or critical bugfixes will result in a new minor release.

* 3rd level: patch level

  Small, non-critical patches will result in a new patch level release.

  
It is highly recommended to update once a new major or minor release is available.
