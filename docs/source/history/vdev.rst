Develop version
===============

FORCE-dev
---------

Main release: TBA

* **General changes**

  * Makefile
    The check for the successful installation has been reworked.
    Thanks to Willi Weber for help on this topic.

* **FORCE L1AS**
  * Added nanoseconds to the temporary folder generated by force-level1-csd.
    This helps if the program is called from a parallel loop.
    Thanks to Pablo Rodríguez-Sánchez for suggesting this feature.

* **FORCE L2PS**

  * new program: force-level2-report
    The new program allows to generate an html report of the Level 2 Processing.

* **FORCE HLPS**

  * A new submodule is available: ``UDF`` plug-in, enabled by the support of Andreas Rabe.
    This submodule is an extension of the plug-in functionality introduced in v3.6.0.
    Python UDFs can now be simply plugged into FORCE, thus running custom Python code without re-compiling FORCE.
    The ``UDF`` submodule acts on the ARD input type (see :ref:`hl-input`).
    Two types of UDFs are supported:
    1) pixel-based UDF: the user only has to write a pixel-function, FORCE takes care of everything else.
    2) block-based UDF: the user has to write a function that receives a block of data. Useful for numpy-stype functions.

    A tutorial is planned to showcase the usage.

  * The usage of the previous UDF functionality within the ``TSA`` submodule was harmonized with the new ``UDF`` submodule.
    You will need to slightly adapt your existing UDF to work with the new version.
    Both UDF types are supported in the ``TSA`` submodule, too.

    A tutorial is planned to showcase the usage.


* **FORCE AUX**

  * force-pyramid takes levels and resampling method as additional arguments.
