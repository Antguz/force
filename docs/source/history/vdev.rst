Develop version
===============

FORCE-dev
---------

Master release: TBA

* **General changes**

    Fixed a small bug that prevented program execution when the parameterfile was too long.

* **FORCE HIGHER LEVEL**

  * in force-higher-level, Level 3 sub-module: 
  
    Included a safety query, which ensures that at least one score should be > 0.
    Setting all scores to 0 resulted in some crashes.
    Thanks to Jonas Ard√∂ to report on this.

  * in force-higher-level, TSA sub-module: 
  
    The domain tag of the bandwise FORCE metadata domain was updated to be interoperable with a 4D data model (see force-stack below).

* **FORCE AUX**

  * in force-mosaic:

    force-mosaic now copies all metadata to the generated mosaics.
    For this, the new aux tool force-mdcp is used

  * new program force-mdcp:
  
    This new helper tool copies metadata from one file to another.
    This included the FORCE metadata domains.
    This program is now used by force-mosaic to carry the metadata to the generated mosaics.

  * new program force-stack:

    This new tool stacks files in VRT format.
    This works with physical images (e.g. GeoTiffs), as well as VRT files (as e.g. generated by force-mosaic).
    A variable number of input files can be stacked, wildcards are supported.
    Most basically, this is e.g. useful to look at RGB combinations in QGIS, where RGB visualizations cannot be used when the channels are not in the same file.
    If the number of bands in the input files is different, the images are stacked after another, e.g. file 1 band 1, file 1 band 2, file 2 band 1.
    If the number of bands in the input files is the same, the images are stacked with band interleave, e.g. file 1 band 1, file 2 band 1, file 1 band 2, file 2 band 2.
    The second option implements a 4D data model (think of time series), which is consistent with the QGIS plugins Raster Time Series Manager and Raster Data Plotting (C) Andreas Rabe.
    A tutorial is in development to illustrate the interoperable use between FORCE and said QGIS plugins.
