Lower Level Components
======================

A typical FORCE workflow consists of following main steps:

1) Level 1 images are acquired from the space agencies, and are 

2) converted to Level 2 ARD, which are 

3) aggregated and analyzed in Higher Level processing.


In FORCE, "Lower Level" is defined as Levels 1-2.

*Note, that the L2IMP module produces Level 2 data, too. However, the processing strategy follows the Higher Level, thus this module is described here (add link).*
