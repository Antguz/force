Level 1 Archiving Suite
=======================

Add more about information.

The FORCE Level 1 Archiving Suite (FORCE L1AS) is intended to assist in organizing and maintaining a clean and consistent Level 1 data pool, as well as downloading of Sentinel-2 data.
It is attempted to reduce redundancy and supports versioning, e.g. by removing old data if new processing versions are available.
In addition, FORCE L1AS assists in building and updating the file queues needed for :ref:`l2ps`.

There are separate methods for Landsat 4/5/7/8 and Sentinel-2A/B:
