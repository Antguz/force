Output Format
=============

Data organization
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The data are organized in a gridded data structure, i.e. data cubes.
The tiles manifest as directories in the file system, and the images are stored within.

.. seealso:: 

  Check out this `tutorial <https://davidfrantz.github.io/tutorials/force-datacube/datacube/>`_, which explains what a datacube is, how it is parameterized, how you can find a POI, how to visualize the tiling grid, and how to conveniently display cubed data.


Data Cube definition
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The spatial data cube definition is appended to each data cube, i.e. to each directory containing tiled datasets, see :ref:`datacube-def`.


Naming convention
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^



File format
^^^^^^^^^^^

The images are provided with signed 16bit datatype and band sequential (BSQ) interleaving in one of the following formats:

* GeoTiff 
  
  This is the recommended output option. 
  Images are compressed GeoTiff images using LZW compression with horizontal differencing.
  The images are generated with internal blocks for partial image access.
  These blocks are strips that are as wide as the ``TILE_SIZE`` and as high as the ``BLOCK_SIZE``.
  
* ENVI Standard format

  This produces flat binary images without any compression.
  This option might seem tempting as there is no overhead in cracking the compression when reading these data.
  However, the transfer of the larger data volume from disc to CPU often takes longer than cracking the compression.
  Therefore, we recommend to use the GeoTiff option.


Metadata
^^^^^^^^

Metadata are written to all output products.
For ENVI format, the metadata are written to the ENVI header (``.hdr`` extension).
For GeoTiff format, the metadata are written into the GeoTiff file.
If the metadata is larger than allowed by the GeoTiff driver, the excess metadata will be written to an "auxiliary metadata" file with ``.aux.xml`` extension.
FORCE-specific metadata will be written to the FORCE domain, and thus are probably not visible unless the FORCE domain (or all domains) are specifically printed:

.. code-block:: bash

  gdalinfo -mdd all 20160823_LEVEL2_SEN2A_BOA.tif


Product type
^^^^^^^^^^^^





Output Format
=============

Output format
Data organization
The output data are organized as the Level 2 data. The output data are appended to the input Level 2 data as new product, i.e. two additional files (image + metadata) appear next to the existing data. Note that the new product will have higher spatial resolution (more pixels) than the other products (e.g. QAI). Higher-level FORCE routines can handle this. For any higher-level FORCE module, you can choose to use the improved product or the original one.

Naming convention
Following 29-digit naming convention is applied to all output files:

20180823_LEVEL2_LND08_IMP.tif
20180823_LEVEL2_LND08_IMP.hdr

The naming convention is the same as for the Level 2 data (see VI.B.5). The only difference is the Product Type, which is set to IMP.
Digits 23â€“25	Product Type
		IMP		ImproPhed Bottom-of-Atmosphere Reflectance (standard output, scale: 10000, nodata: -9999)

Product type
There is only one product type, i.e. the ImproPhed Bottom-of-Atmosphere Reflectance (IMP). The IMP product has the same specification as the BOA product, but spatial resolution was enhanced.

File format
The data are provided in compressed GeoTiff or flat binary ENVI Standard format. Each dataset consists of an image dataset (.tif/.dat) and metadata (.hdr). The image data have signed 16bit datatype. Each predicted image is stored as separate file.
The metadata (.hdr) are provided in ENVI Standard format as human-readable text using tag and value notation. Metadata include image characteristics like dimensions, data type, band interleave, coordinate reference system, map info, band names etc.
