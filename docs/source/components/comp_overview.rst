Overview
========

FORCE is a software framework and consists of several modules and executables, which are organized in components according to processing levels.

  * :ref:`lower-level` is defined as Levels 1-2, 

  * :ref:`hlps` as Level 3 and above, 

  * :ref:`aux-level` components are helper programs for specific purposes.


A typical FORCE workflow consists of following main steps:

  1) Level 1 images are acquired from the space agencies, and are 

  2) converted to Level 2 ARD, which are 

  3) aggregated and/or analyzed in Higher Level processing.
