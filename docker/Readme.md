# FORCE v3.0 with Docker

## Use prebuilt image

The easiest way to use FORCE with Docker is to use a prebuilt image pulled from [Docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/) with the following command:

```sh
# This takes only a few minutes
docker pull fegyi001/force:latest
```

This downloads the latest, fully featured FORCE (^3.x) on your local machine including SPLITS.
You can use FORCE like this:

```sh
docker run fegyi001/force force
```

Which outputs a default message showing that FORCE works indeed (the exact version may differ):

```sh

## Local build

If you wish to build a Docker image instead of using the prebuilt version you can do it with the following steps **from the root folder**:

```sh
# This may take some time (up to 10-20 minutes).
# The '-t' flag indicates how your local image will be called, in this case 'my-force'
docker build -t my-force .
```

After that, you can use your newly built Docker image like this:

```sh
docker run my-force force
```

The rest is up to you, you can do anything Docker containers support. E.g. you wish to add a volume to the container and run a `force-level2` command is as simple as that:

```sh
# Let's say you have a parameter file in /my/local/folder/parameters.prm
# You map your local folder into /opt/data for your force container
# Without it FORCE will not be able to see your local files since it is isolated
docker run -v /my/local/folder:/opt/data my-force force-level2 /opt/data/parameters.prm
```
